## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- 4GB+ RAM (recommended for model loading)
- Internet connection (first run only, for model download)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-flashcard-generator.git
   cd llm-flashcard-generator
   ```

   **Option 2: Manual Setup**

   python3 -m venv flashcard_env
   source flashcard_env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

```
app.py                 # Main Streamlit application
├── flashcard_generator.py  # AI model and generation logic
├── file_processor.py       # File handling (txt, pdf)
├── exporter.py            # Export functionality
└── utils.py               # Utility functions
```

### Key Classes

- **FileProcessor**: Processes uploaded files and extracts text
- **FlashcardExporter**: Manages export to different formats
- **TextUtils**: Text processing and cleaning utilities
- **ValidationUtils**: Validates flashcard quality

## 🤖 AI Model Details

### Model Selection

- **Primary**: Google FLAN-T5 Base (780M parameters)
- **Fallback**: Rule-based generation system
- **Device**: Automatic GPU/CPU detection

### Model Features

- **No API Keys**: Runs completely offline after initial download
- **Local Processing**: All data stays on your machine
- **Efficient**: Optimized for consumer hardware
- **Reliable**: Fallback system ensures consistent operation

## 📝 Sample Output

### Generated Flashcard Example

```json
{
  "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
  "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water.",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "topic": "Plant Biology",
  "subject": "Biology",
  "language": "English"
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Configuration

The application uses FLAN-T5 Base by default. To use a different model, modify `flashcard_generator.py`:

```python
self.model_name = "google/flan-t5-large"  # For better quality
# or
self.model_name = "google/flan-t5-small"  # For faster processing
```

### Performance Tuning

- **GPU Usage**: Automatically detected and utilized if available
- **Memory Management**: Uses float16 precision on GPU for efficiency
- **Batch Processing**: Processes content in manageable chunks

## 📊 Export Format Examples

### Anki Format

```
What is mitosis?	The process by which a cell divides to form two identical daughter cells	Biology difficulty_medium
```

### Quizlet Format

```
What is mitosis?	The process by which a cell divides to form two identical daughter cells
```

### CSV Format

```csv
question,answer,difficulty,topic,subject,language
"What is mitosis?","The process by which a cell divides...","Medium","Cell Biology","Biology","English"
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Export Formats

1. Add method to `FlashcardExporter` class
2. Update the export tab in `app.py`
3. Add format-specific validation

### Extending AI Models

1. Modify `flashcard_generator.py`
2. Update model loading logic
3. Adjust prompt engineering for new models

### Custom Subjects

Add new subjects to the subjects list in `app.py`:

```python
subjects = [..., "Your New Subject"]
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Download Slow**

   - First run downloads ~1GB model
   - Subsequent runs are fast
   - Check internet connection

2. **Memory Errors**

   - Reduce content chunk size
   - Use smaller model variant
   - Close other applications

3. **PDF Processing Issues**
   - Ensure PDF contains text (not just images)
   - Try converting to .txt first
   - Check file permissions

### Performance Tips

- **GPU**: Install CUDA for GPU acceleration
- **Memory**: 8GB+ RAM recommended for large documents
- **Storage**: Ensure 2GB+ free space for model cache
